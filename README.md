<h4> I am aware that the site seems to look archaic and very simple. It also looks that way because I created it according to the project guidelines. The purpose of the project was to create the layout itself. This one, in turn, due to the level of knowledge at the time, did not allow for the implementation of fully working functions. However, I added it to my repository to track my progress in web development and show it to you. </h4>
